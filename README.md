## Algorithm

I have implemented some algorithms in [copypasta](./copypasta).

## How to Practice

> 1. Starting from problems with difficulty equal to ("Your rating" + 200), you will be solving problem that will be quite hard for you.
>
> 2. Spend no more than 10 minutes before look at the solution.
>
> 3. Train on constructive problems ("constructive algorithms" tag on CF) will significantly improve the time you spend on finding observations.
