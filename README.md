## Algorithm

I have implemented some algorithms in [copypasta](./copypasta).

## How to Practice

> 1. Starting from problems with difficulty equal to ("Your rating" + 200), you will be solving problem that will be quite hard for you.
>
> 2. Spend no more than 10 minutes before look at the solution.
>
> 3. Train on constructive problems ("constructive algorithms" tag on CF) will significantly improve the time you spend on finding observations.

## BST

Golang doesn't have a built-in BST. I use [treap](./copypasta/treap.go) after some research.

> Binary search tree (BST) based data structures, such as AVL trees, red-black trees, and splay trees, are often used in system software, such as operating system kernels. 
> Choosing the right kind of tree can impact performance significantly, but the literature offers few empirical studies for guidance. 
> We compare 20 BST variants using three experiments in real-world scenarios with real and artificial workloads. 
> The results indicate that when input is expected to be randomly ordered with occasional runs of sorted order, red-black trees are preferred; 
> when insertions often occur in sorted order, AVL trees excel for later random access, whereas splay trees perform best for later sequential or clustered access. 
> **For node representations, use of parent pointers is shown to be the fastest choice**, with threaded nodes a close second choice that saves memory; nodes without parent pointers or threads suffer when traversal and modification are combined; maintaining an in-order doubly linked list is advantageous when traversal is very common; and right-threaded nodes perform poorly.
