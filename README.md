> Notice that sorting problems by the rating also sorts problems with the same rating by solving amount. So, I would say; Choose a rating (for example, I would choose 1400 for you for now); Sort by the rating; And, finally, start solving from the most solved 1400.
>
> If you feel that rating X is easy enough for you, check if you can solve least solved problems with X rating. Surely, you don't have to solve all problems with rating X, there are tons of them. Just step to X+100 when you feel ready.

> Good luck!
