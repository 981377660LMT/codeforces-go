## How to Choose Problems

> Notice that sorting problems by the rating also sorts problems with the same rating by solving amount. So, I would say; Choose a rating (for example, I would choose 1400 for you for now); Sort by the rating; And, finally, start solving from the most solved 1400.
>
> If you feel that rating X is easy enough for you, check if you can solve least solved problems with X rating. Surely, you don't have to solve all problems with rating X, there are tons of them. Just step to X+100 when you feel ready.

> Good luck!

## BST

> Binary search tree (BST) based data structures, such as AVL trees, red-black trees, and splay trees, are often used in system software, such as operating system kernels. 
> Choosing the right kind of tree can impact performance significantly, but the literature offers few empirical studies for guidance. 
> We compare 20 BST variants using three experiments in real-world scenarios with real and artificial workloads. 
> The results indicate that when input is expected to be randomly ordered with occasional runs of sorted order, red-black trees are preferred; 
> when insertions often occur in sorted order, AVL trees excel for later random access, whereas splay trees perform best for later sequential or clustered access. 
> **For node representations, use of parent pointers is shown to be the fastest choice**, with threaded nodes a close second choice that saves memory; nodes without parent pointers or threads suffer when traversal and modification are combined; maintaining a in-order doubly linked list is advantageous when traversal is very common; and right-threaded nodes perform poorly.
